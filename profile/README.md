# HamAlert

## Introduction
This organization and its repositories contains the source code for the frontend and backend components of [HamAlert](https://hamalert.org), a system that allows amateur radio operators to receive push notifications through various channels if an amateur radio station is spotted through one of several spot sources (e.g. DX cluster, RBN, PSK Reporter etc.). Users can define criteria (called "triggers" and "conditions") to filter the spots that they are interested in.

## Reporting bugs
If you would like to report a bug, please open an issue in the repository that the bug most likely pertains to:

- App bugs: [hamalert-app](https://github.com/hamalert/hamalert-app/issues)
- Server/spot processing bugs: [hamalert-server](https://github.com/hamalert/hamalert-server/issues)
- Website bugs: [hamalert-web](https://github.com/hamalert/hamalert-web/issues)

If you are not sure whether something is a bug or perhaps rather a case of not understanding how something works or should be configured, please post on the [HamAlert forum](https://forum.hamalert.org) instead.

## Requesting features
If you have a feature request, please open an issue in the repository that it most likely pertains to (see above) and add the "enhancement" label. Please check if there is already a feature request with the same general idea before you open a new one.

## Contributing code
PRs for bug fixes are always welcome. If you intend to add a new feature, please [open a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/hamalert/discussions) first to discuss what you want to implement, and how, with the team.
