## Push notifications for amateur radio spots

This organization and its repositories contains the source code for the frontend and backend components of HamAlert, a system for amateur radio operators that allows them to receive push notifications through various channels if an amateur radio station is spotted in one of several spot sources. Users can define criteria (called "triggers" and "conditions") to filter the spots that they are interested in.
